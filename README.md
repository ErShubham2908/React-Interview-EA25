### Q1. What is SPA ( Single Page Application) 
- SPA stands for Single Page Application, and it's a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. React is a popular JavaScript library for building SPAs.
- A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads all of its content on a single HTML page. This is in contrast to traditional web applications, which load a new HTML page for each new view. SPAs are more responsive and user-friendly, as users do not have to wait for new pages to load every time they interact with the application.
- In a React SPA, the initial HTML page typically only contains a single "div" element, which serves as the entry point for the React application. When the page loads, React renders the initial UI based on the state of the application. As the user interacts with the application, React updates the UI in response to events such as button clicks or form submissions.

###### One advantage of using a React SPA is that it can provide a smoother and more responsive user experience compared to traditional web applications, since the page does not need to reload every time the user interacts with it. However, SPAs can be more complex to build and maintain, since they require more client-side code and may require additional server-side infrastructure to support the API.

### Q2. What is Virtual DOM?
