### Q1. What is an event in react?
- An event in React is an action that is triggered by the user or the system. For example, a mouse click, keyboard press, or window resize are all events. React has its own event handling system, which is known as **Synthetic Events**. Synthetic Events are cross-browser wrappers of the browser's native events, which means that they have the same interface and behavior across all browsers.
- To handle events in React, you use event handlers. Event handlers are functions that are passed to React elements as props. When the event is triggered, the function is called with an event object as the argument. The event object contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the target element, and any additional data.
  
- Here are some examples of common events in React:
  - onClick: Fired when the user clicks an element.
  - onChange: Fired when the user changes the value of an input element.
  - onSubmit: Fired when the user submits a form.
  - onKeyPress: Fired when the user presses a key on the keyboard.
  - onMouseOver: Fired when the user moves the mouse cursor over an element.
  - onMouseOut: Fired when the user moves the mouse cursor away from an element.
